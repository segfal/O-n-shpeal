# O(n) examples

## We will be going for the number of steps.
## our goal is the number 10. 
### O(1) constant time
[1] # O(1) 1 step

### O(log n) logarithmic time

[1,2,4,6,8] # O(log n) 5 steps


### O(n) linear time
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] # O(n) 10 steps

### O(n^2) quadratic time
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] # O(n^2) 100 steps
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
